# Growth-rate-calculator

Purpose:
Matlab program for automatic calculation of bacterial growth rate in time-course microplate experiments

Experimental design (microplate layout):
Data analysis will only take place correctly if the following microplate layout is applied.
Column 1: Media blank
Columns 2 up to 12: Sample conditions
Rows A up to G: Replicates

Data analysis:
Open matlab software and run "growth_rate_module.m" file script. (Instructions for file naming etc can be found in the script)
